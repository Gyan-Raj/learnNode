1. inside .writeHead(), where we are sending the status code and content type, we can also pass any custom data
    //by convention, it must start with "x", like(x-reqId, or x-value etc)
    //let us send a unique id
    //which we are going to use "crypto" which is a standard node module which comes with node and is used to generate a unique id
    
const crypto = require("crypto");
res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "application/json" ,"x-req-id":reqId});

2. now we will be working on how to change the response, depending on parameters => How will the server know what kind of request is received from the client or at which endpoint? => So, till now, when we send request (from requests.rest file) at any url path (http://localhost:8082 or http://localhost:8082/users or any other path, we will get the same response)=> i.e., we will be learning about use of Request object (basically the req.url method)

    //if we hit a GET request at http://localhost:8082/users or http://localhost:8082/users, and also try to console req.url in http.createServer((res, req)=>console.log(req.url)), it will give us / and /users as an output respectively=> it means that req.url indicates the path of the request
    //So, depending upon whether req.url==="/" or req.url==="/users", we can send the response accordingly (NOTE that currently we are getting same response for any url path (i.e., currently, we are getting same response for / as well as /users))

    //So, we will be sending serverInfo at "/", a html file at "/users" and a status code of 400 at any oyher path

let PORT = 8082;

const http = require("http");
const crypto = require("crypto");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  let reqId = crypto.randomUUID();
  console.log(reqId);
  if (req.url === "/") {
    const serverInfo = {
      serverName: "Session1_4 server",
      version: "1.0.0",
      currentDate: new Date().toDateString(),
      currentTime: new Date().toTimeString(),
    };
    res.writeHead(200, {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      "x-req-id": reqId,
    });
    res.write(JSON.stringify(serverInfo));
  } else if (req.url === "/users") {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/html", "x-req-id": reqId });
    res.write(`
      <h1>Hello Users</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>User1</li>
        <li>User2</li>
        <li>User3</li>
      </ul>
      `);
  } else {
    res.writeHead(400, { "Content-Type": "text/html", "x-req-id": reqId });
    res.write(`
      <h1>Page not found</h1>
      `);
  }
  res.end();
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port: ${PORT}`);
});
